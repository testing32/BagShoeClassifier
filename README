HW #1 - Kyle Miller

You need the following python libraries:
numpy
cpickle (part 4)
theano (If you want to create your own NN for part 4)
opencv with python bindings (color histograms for part 4)

How to run:

In __main__ there is are commented out lines which can be easily replaced
with your arguments for each of the parts

The following functions solve each of the corresponding parts

Part 1 - queryImage(queryImage, dictionaryDir)
Part 2 - queryDescription(queryText, dictionaryDir)
Part 3 - queryCombined(queryImage, queryText, dictionaryDir)
Part 4 - NN model generated in myconvnet.py. The model is then pickled and used by hw1. 
	partFour(queryImage, queryText, dictionaryDir, modelName)
